Shimmerpp is intended to serve as a hub for developers interested in the [Shimmer ecosystem](https://shimmer.network/).
It's purpose is to create a community of C++ developers that use and trust the IOTA/Shimmer protocol.


The community is open for all experience levels of C++ and all types of contributions.
It is intended to create discussion and fill the gaps of the interested user or developer when interacting with the Layer 1.  


### The idea

The idea around a Qt/C++ community in the Shimmer ecosystem comes from [Eddy](https://eddytheco.github.io/) and was supported by a [grant](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OreNx0aesdrQuHYCIU9wbD3c_ZbxNjnv/view?usp=share_link) from the
[Tangle Community Treasury](https://www.tangletreasury.org/).

 

### Contributing
All kind of contributions are welcome.
From documenting code to creating the most advance algorithm for doing PoW.
Also blog entries showcasing applications, new ideas, etc are welcome in the blog.
 
The main guidelines when contributing are

- Keep it simple.

- Code once deploy everywhere.

- Explain as much as you can. 

- Make sure to acknowledge your work, idea ... 


### Main Components

The different base components for interacting with the Shimmer Layer 1 are

- [Universal private key derivation from master private key](https://github.com/EddyTheCo/Qslip10)

- [Checksummed base32 format addresses](https://github.com/EddyTheCo/Qbech32)

- [Proof-of-work as a means to rate-limit the network](https://github.com/EddyTheCo/Qpow-IOTA)

- [Ed25519 elliptic curve signature scheme](https://github.com/EddyTheCo/Qed25519)

- [Blocks and UTXOs](https://github.com/EddyTheCo/Qblock-IOTA) 

- [Client to communicate with the REST API of the nodes](https://github.com/EddyTheCo/Qclient-IOTA)

- [Client to communicate with the Node Event API of the nodes](https://github.com/EddyTheCo/QclientMqtt-IOTA)
